I will fulfill my duty.

30
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,514
He seems to be a clever boy.

31
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:34,519
Well, I was depressed
because we couldn't have a child,

32
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,022
{\an8}but I'm relieved
since a good child came by.

33
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,417
Now we're happy
that our days have become enjoyable.

34
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,586
He's a kind boy.

35
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,798
He's even considerate to our servants.

36
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,760
He's so polite that it's hard
to believe he's still a child.

37
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,263
Even though we're not related by blood,

38
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,515
parents will always understand
their children.

39
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,352
I will let him succeed in my footsteps.

40
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,646
That makes me envious.

41
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,191
I would like to swap my son with yours.

42
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,364
He's really a good boy, but…

43
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,701
he has a skin disease.

44
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,370
He can't go outside during the daytime.

45
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,206
Oh, poor boy.

46
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,628
{\an8}I think it would be great
if our company could make the cure.

47
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,839
{\an8}As soon as possible.

48
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,476
I have come to make a report,

49
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,269
Lord Muzan.

50
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,401
Did you find the thing I asked for?

51
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,739
{\an8}I did some investigations but
I did not find any reliable information.

52
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,241
I could not confirm its existence.

53
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,412
<i>The Blue Spider Lily
is nowhere to be found.</i>

54
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,999
So?

55
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:26,672
{\an8}From now on, I will do my best
to live up to your expectations.

56
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,760
I have dealt with one of the Hashiras
as you ordered.

57
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,012
Please do not worry.

58
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:43,147
{\an8}You seem to be
misunderstanding something, Akaza.

59
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,945
It's only a Hashira.

60
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,156
If you could kill a Hashira, so what?

61
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,869
It's only natural for demons
to defeat humans.

62
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,791
What I desire is the total annihilation
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

63
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:09,632
{\an8}Eliminate every single one of them
so I won't see them ever again.

64
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,594
It shouldn't be complicated.

65
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,097
And yet, it still hasn't been achieved.

66
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,140
Can you explain it?

67
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,939
You proudly report
that you killed a Hashira,

68
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,693
but there were still
three demon hunters in that place.

69
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,571
Why didn't you deal with them?

70
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:36,242
I even took the trouble
to let you head there who was nearby.

71
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,662
Akaza.

72
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,123
Akaza.

73
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,667
Akaza.

74
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,253
{\an8}Akaza!

75
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm disappointed in you.

76
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:57,013
To think that you took a blow
from a swordsman who isn't a Hashira.

77
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,641
The Upper Rank Three has fallen.

78
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,647
Begone.

79
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,865
I heard a loud noise.

80
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,783
Are you okay?

81
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,800
<i>You coward!</i>

82
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,356
{\an8}<i>You coward!</i>

83
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,445
I remember your face, brat!

84
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:59,283
Next time we meet,
I'll blow your brains up!

85
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:41,242
<i>Even Tanjiro gets depressed
and thinks he might be useless.</i>

86
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,537
<i>Well, of course.</i>

87
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:50,793
<i>Even someone who has a well-trained sound
like Rengoku ends up dying.</i>

88
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,589
<i>That kind of shock
could mess you up, I know.</i>

89
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,344
<i>Even Inosuke cried his heart out.</i>

90
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,721
<i>That must have been frustrating for him.</i>

91
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:08,269
<i>No matter how strong a person is,
they can still feel pain and sadness.</i>

92
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,357
<i>But we can't keep sitting around
all the time.</i>

93
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,111
<i>We have to strike our wounded spirits,
repeatedly, to get back up.</i>

94
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,072
<i>I'm sure that's what Rengoku would do.</i>

95
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,867
<i>Because I heard that sound from him.</i>

96
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,413
<i>It was a bit strange,
but he sounded strong and gentle.</i>

97
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,001
Tanjiro, I sneaked you some buns.

98
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,294
Let's eat them!

99
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,380
Tanjiro is gone!

100
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,301
I'm so sorry, Zenitsu!

101
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,889
It's okay. I'm completely fine.

102
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,890
What's wrong?

103
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,642
But you don't seem to be fine!

104
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,145
I'm really so sorry!

105
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,522
-I can't find Tanjiro anywhere!
-It's okay.

106
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,276
He was training
even when his wounds hadn't healed yet,

107
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,904
so Miss Shinobu got angry!

108
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,907
Though I've told him to rest!

109
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,619
The wound in his stomach
was pretty deep, right?

110
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,245
Is he a fool?

111
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,469
<i>Rengoku's crow…</i>

112
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:28,724
<i>Thank you for guiding me
to fulfill Rengoku's final wishes.</i>

113
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,332
Are you Senjuro?

114
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,428
Have you heard
about Kyojuro Rengoku's obituary?

115
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,850
I was given messages
for your father and you from Kyojuro.

116
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,687
Thus, I'm here to tell the messages.

117
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,482
From my brother?

118
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,652
I already know what happened
to my brother.

119
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,114
Hey. Are you okay?

120
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,157
You look really pale.

121
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,703
Stop it!

122
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,081
I'm sure he left useless crap anyway.

123
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,586
{\an8}It's because he became a swordsman
despite having no talent.

124
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,421
{\an8}That's why he died.

125
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,172
{\an8}Worthless!

126
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,509
{\an8}Kyojuro is a foolish son!

127
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,098
People's abilities are determined
from the moment they're born.

128
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,518
Only a few people have talent,

129
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,605
the rest are just rabble.

130
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,191
They are just worthless rubbish.

131
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,196
Kyojuro was one of them.

132
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,449
He had no great talent.

133
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,993
That's the reason he ended up dead.

134
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,998
Senjuro, the funeral's over.

135
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,460
Don't make that pathetic face again!

136
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,005
Wait a second, sir.

137
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,008
That's a terrible thing to say.

138
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,385
Please stop talking that way!

139
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,930
Who are you?

140
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,848
Get out!

141
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,142
Don't step into my threshold!

142
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,728
I'm from the Corps.

143
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,984
You…

144
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,696
I see. You're…

145
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,658
{\an8}the Sun Breathing user, right?

146
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,867
{\an8}I'm sure you are!

147
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,871
Sun Breathing? What are you talking about?

148
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,255
<i>He's so fast.
That wasn't the move of an amateur.</i>

149
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,591
Father, please stop!

150
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,468
Please look at his face!

151
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,886
He's not feeling well!

152
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,554
Shut up! Silence!

153
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,851
{\an8}That's enough, you bastard!

154
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,403
Just what have you been doing?

155
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,489
Not only insulting your son
who lost his life,

156
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,116
but even hitting your other son!

157
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,201
What do you want?

158
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:40,749
{\an8}You're making fun of us, aren't you?

159
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,085
Why would you think that?

160
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,087
I have no idea what you're talking about.

161
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,755
That's a false accusation!

162
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,634
Because you're a Sun Breathing user.

163
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,138
I know those earrings.

164
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,597
It was written!

165
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,854
{\an8}<i>Could it be that by "Sun Breathing,"
he meant "Hinokami Kagura"?</i>

166
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,481
The original breathing.

167
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,901
The first breathing ever created.

168
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,529
The godly technique.

169
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,950
<i>All the other breathing techniques
are just derivatives of Sun Breathing.</i>

170
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,540
Every other breathing is nothing more
than the imitation of Sun Breathing.

171
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,794
Those are just inferior copies
of Sun Breathing.

172
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,715
Fire, water, wind, all of them!

173
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,718
<i>What does that mean?</i>

174
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,220
<i>My family has been charcoal burners
for generations.</i>

175
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,765
<i>We even have our family tree.</i>

176
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,476
<i>Sun Breathing…</i>

177
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,520
<i>Hinokami Kagura…</i>

178
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>Wait.</i>

179
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,941
<i>There's something…</i>

180
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,819
<i>more important than that.</i>

181
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:57,451
{\an8}Don't get full of yourself just because
I said you're a Sun Breathing user, brat!

182
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,748
Why would I get full of myself?

183
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:07,544
{\an8}Do you know how devastated I am
by my own weakness right now?

184
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,505
{\an8}You…

185
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,173
shitty old man!

186
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,800
Watch out! My father is…

187
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:17,054
Don't speak ill of Rengoku!

188
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,597
{\an8}…a former Hashira!

189
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,936
Please stop it, Father!

190
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,105
<i>Why?</i>

191
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>If Hinokami Kagura is the Sun Breathing,</i>

192
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:37,616
<i>why couldn't I save Rengoku back then?</i>

193
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,079
<i>Why?</i>

194
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,081
{\an8}<i>Why?</i>

195
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,754
<i>Just why?</i>

196
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,225
<i>I've done it.</i>

197
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,440
Here's the tea.

198
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,777
Yes, thank you.

199
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,991
I'm truly sorry
for headbutting your father.

200
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,909
Is he okay?

201
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,704
I think he'll be fine.

202
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,000
{\an8}When he woke up, he went out to buy sake.

203
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,711
I see.

204
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,921
Thank you very much.

205
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,423
What?

206
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,509
I feel relieved.

207
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:43,307
I couldn't even talk back to him
when he spoke ill of my brother.

208
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,440
<i>I wonder how
my brother's final moments were.</i>

209
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,867
Is that so?

210
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,370
He fulfilled his duties until the end.

211
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,165
Thank you very much.

212
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,877
Oh, no, don't be like that.

213
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,881
{\an8}I'm the one who's sorry
for not being of any help.

214
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,595
Please don't worry about it.

215
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,225
I'm sure that's what
my brother would have said.

216
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,610
I have an idea
which book my father used to read.

217
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,528
THE 21ST GENERATION
OF FLAME HASHIRA RECORD

218
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,156
I think this might be it.

219
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,078
Thank you very much.

220
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,290
Maybe it has something
that you want to know.

221
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,797
{\an8}This is…

222
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,258
This is…

223
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,057
The pages are all torn up.

224
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,976
Most of them are unreadable.

225
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,270
Was it originally like this?

226
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,439
No, I don't think so.

227
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:19,361
The Generational Flame Hashira Record
is supposed to be preserved well.

228
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,823
{\an8}I think my father tore it.

229
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,117
{\an8}I'm very sorry.

230
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,162
Don't be. It's not your fault.

231
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,581
Please don't mind it.

232
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,043
You've come all this way,

233
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,756
but in the end, you've found nothing about
Hinokami Kagura and the Sun Breathing

234
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,675
that my father mentioned.

235
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,302
It's fine.

236
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,263
I know what I have to do.

237
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,807
I'll train harder.

238
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,772
<i>Even though I know
how to unleash Hinokami Kagura,</i>

239
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,026
<i>I can't perform it perfectly.</i>

240
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,946
Is that so?

241
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,867
When I unleash Hinokami Kagura
in Total Concentration state,

242
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,953
it's hard to move my body as I want.

243
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,748
So it's my problem.

244
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,126
My body can't catch up with my technique.

245
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,464
My physical strength has improved
with Total Concentration: Constant,

246
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,215
but it's still not enough.

247
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,972
If I could use it constantly,
my strength would improve day by day,

248
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,433
but it won't get me stronger
in an instant.

249
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,188
<i>If only I had been stronger back then…</i>

250
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:42,235
<i>If only there was an instant way
to become strong enough to save Rengoku…</i>

251
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,114
I've been thinking about it.

252
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,951
But there's no convenient way.

253
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,037
There are no shortcuts.

254
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,915
I have to struggle.

255
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,877
I have to move forward
with my best at the moment.

256
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,799
No matter how painful
or frustrating it might be.

257
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:10,013
I will definitely become a strong Hashira

258
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,767
like Kyojuro.

259
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,821
My brother never had a Tsuguko.

260
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,701
<i>I should be his Tsuguko.</i>

261
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,957
<i>I had to heap up my achievements
as a reserve Hashira.</i>

262
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,751
<i>But…</i>

263
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:45,090
<i>my Nichirin Sword didn't change its color.</i>

264
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,262
The color of Nichirin Swords won't change

265
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,181
until you have mastered
a certain level of swordsmanship.

266
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,145
No matter how much I practiced,

267
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,689
it was useless for me.

268
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,611
So I'm giving up being a swordsman.

269
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,369
I decided to help people in other ways.

270
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,707
<i>It will break
the inheritance of Flame Hashiras</i>

271
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,418
<i>and make a scar in a long history.</i>

272
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,921
<i>But I believe my brother</i>

273
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,883
<i>will forgive me.</i>

274
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,933
Please walk down the path
that you feel is right.

275
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,604
{\an8}If anyone badmouths you,

276
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,606
{\an8}I'll headbutt them!

277
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,108
Please don't.

278
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,533
I'll try to restore
the Generational Flame Hashira Record

279
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,952
and I'll look up other books, too.

280
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,121
I'll also try to ask my father.

281
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,665
I'll send a message via crow
when I find something.

282
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,544
I'm glad we were able to talk.

283
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,672
Please be careful on your way home.

284
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,594
With pleasure. Thank you very much.

285
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,013
One more thing, Tanjiro.

286
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,808
Please take it.

287
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,606
It's my brother's Nichirin Sword guard.

288
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,569
I can't accept something so valuable.

289
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,946
I…

290
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,907
{\an8}I want you to take it.

291
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,869
{\an8}I'm sure it will protect you.

292
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,551
Thank you.

293
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,729
<i>Excuse me.</i>

294
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,485
You're back.

295
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,612
About a while ago…

296
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,905
Shut up!

297
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,324
I don't care. Get out of here!

298
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,119
But Rengoku's…

299
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,620
Worthless!

300
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,999
It's probably just a grudge
against me anyway.

301
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,625
I know it.

302
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,545
Get out already!

303
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,883
Understood.

304
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,020
"Please take care of yourself."

305
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,567
Those were the only words he left for you.

306
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,616
I'm off, Father.

307
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,181
Kyojuro…

308
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,313
<i>Am I getting a fever?</i>

309
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,024
<i>It hurts.</i>

310
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,493
It's all right, Nezuko.

311
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,621
We'll arrive
at the Butterfly Mansion soon.

312
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,341
Ha…

313
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,344
Haganezuka?

314
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:04,641
How could you lose
your sword, you bastard?

315
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,935
You deserve to die!

316
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,356
You bastard deserve to die!

317
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,149
I'm sorry!

318
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,652
I am truly very sorry!

319
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:38,049
<i>I've heard Haganezuka's chase
continued until nearly dawn.</i>

320
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,343
That's why you've got no appetite?

321
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,720
Give it to me then!

322
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,229
Come here.

323
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,856
Thank you!

324
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:01,406
If Aoi and the others hadn't calmed him,

325
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,867
I think it would have gone until noon.

326
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,329
Do you want seconds?

327
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,248
-Want seconds?
-Want seconds?

328
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,333
Give it to me!

329
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,754
Thank you for yesterday, Aoi.

330
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,923
Thank you Sumi, Kiyo, and Naho, too.

331
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,302
It was not a big deal.

332
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,016
What's Haganezuka doing now?

333
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:33,021
<i>Haganezuka is eating</i> mitarashi dango
<i>on the porch.</i>

334
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,400
<i>Somehow, he's in a better mood now.</i>

335
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,611
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

336
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,492
<i>Mitarashi dango</i> is
Mr. Haganezuka's favorite food.

337
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,661
Buy him some of it when he gets angry.

338
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,289
I want to eat that too!

339
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,501
All right then, I'll buy it for you later.

340
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,098
Die!

341
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,767
I could die!

342
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,520
{\an8}A hundred more.

343
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:24,447
<i>It's been four months
since Rengoku's passing.</i>

344
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,952
<i>In between everyday training,</i>

345
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,122
<i>we followed orders we got from the crows,</i>

346
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,420
<i>and each of us went out to defeat demons.</i>

347
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,714
-Be careful!
-Be careful!

348
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,636
{\an8}<i>When Zenitsu went on a mission alone,
he no longer threw tantrums.</i>

349
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,639
Give me a strand of Nezuko's hair.

350
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,224
I promise I'll do my best.

351
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:55,436
<i>Inosuke is more assaulting
like a pig than before.</i>

352
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,481
Run until your bones break!

353
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,233
Come on, you pip-squeak!

354
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,902
<i>I think, not being alone…</i>

355
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,073
We're almost there. Hang on!

356
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,451
-Nezuko!
<i>-…is a blessing.</i>

357
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,748
Nezuko!

358
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,335
North-northwest!

359
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:24,007
Defeat the demons hiding
in the mountain temple!

360
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,261
North-northwest!

361
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,077
Are you all right, Nezuko?

362
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,996
Are you getting wet because of the rain?

363
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,463
There should be demons around here.

364
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,531
Let's go, Nezuko!

365
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,301
<i>Oh, no,
he's going to give us some trouble.</i>

366
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,429
<i>He's going down to the village.</i>

367
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,453
Damn it.

368
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,707
What kind of demon hunter is he?

369
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,710
He's got a demon with him.

370
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,468
That's enough. Prepare yourself.

371
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,596
I'm sorry.

372
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,517
Don't underestimate me, brat!

373
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:46,649
{\an8}<i>Total Concentration,
Water Breathing, Fourth Form:</i>

374
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,865
<i>Striking Tide!</i>

375
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,879
It's strange.

376
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,175
I'm pretty sure I heard a noise.

377
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,109
I'm so tired.

378
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,447
Nezuko, we're almost
at the Butterfly Mansion.

379
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,956
Please don't!

380
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,960
No!

381
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:53,007
Please let us, her and I, go!

382
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,010
-Please!
-So annoying! Just shut up!

383
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,887
Please don't!

384
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,765
Please let them go!

385
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,351
Kanao!

386
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,229
<i>Missions. Orders. Shinobu.</i>

387
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,773
<i>Superiors. Aoi. Naho.</i>

388
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,359
<i>Hashira. Coin. Orders.</i>

389
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,986
<i>Coin!</i>

390
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,863
<i>Toss the coin to decide.</i>

391
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,785
<i>Follow your heart!</i>

392
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,831
Kanao!

393
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,958
Miss Kanao!

394
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,842
Kanao…

395
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,594
-Miss Kanao…
-Miss Kanao…

396
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,391
Don't pull me so plainly.

397
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,686
You just received your orders, right?

398
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,399
Say something!

399
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,775
You are really a plain person!

400
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,070
Charge!

401
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,697
Charge!

402
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,199
-Charge!
-What?

403
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,452
Hey! Cut it out, damn it!

404
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,582
{\an8}What are you doing to the girls?

405
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,208
{\an8}Let them go!

406
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,631
<i>Wait. The girls are swarming him?</i>

407
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,883
<i>Is he--</i>

408
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,301
<i>Which is it?</i>

409
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,722
{\an8}It's a kidnapping! Please save them!

410
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,433
You dumb little brat!

411
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,699
Are you okay?

412
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,117
Yes!

413
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,036
You fool.

414
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,791
I'm the Great Tengen Uzui, a former ninja.

415
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,921
The man who is known as the most
flamboyant in these neighborhoods.

416
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,425
{\an8}Did you think I would get headbutted
by a snotty brat like you?

417
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,845
Give Aoi and Naho back, you kidnapper!

418
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,513
Yes! That's right!

419
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,807
What are you planning to do?

420
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,809
Pervert!

421
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,063
You damn brats!
Who do you think you're talking to?

422
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,066
I'm your superior! A Hashira!
You damn little rascals!

423
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,151
I don't acknowledge you as a Hashira!

424
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,529
Don't you dare pout at me!

425
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,116
You don't acknowledge me, so what?
You lowly brat!

426
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,661
Is your brain completely dead?

427
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,456
I need female members on the mission,
so I'm bringing them along.

428
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,960
I don't need Kocho's permission
if they're not Tsugukos.

429
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,420
Naho isn't even a hunter!

430
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,172
Look! She isn't wearing a uniform!

431
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,843
I don't need her then.

432
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,600
{\an8}What are you doing? You inhuman bastard!

433
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,310
{\an8}He dropped me!

434
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,438
Anyway, I'm taking her to my mission.

435
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,816
I don't think she'll be useful,

436
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,610
{\an8}but she's still our member regardless.

437
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,239
{\an8}People have their own circumstances,

438
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,534
{\an8}so I would like you
to stop poking around insensitively!

439
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,411
Let go of Aoi!

440
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,705
Dull.

441
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,290
You're so dull.

442
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,710
You guys are doing nothing,
and are plain here,

443
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,713
that's why the Corps is getting weaker.

444
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,430
We'll go in Aoi's stead.

445
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,224
"We"?

446
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,161
Who the hell are you?

447
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,787
What's your point?

448
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:56,542
I've just come back,
but I still have a lot of strength.

449
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,836
Ready to head out anytime.

450
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,840
{\an8}Let go of Aoi!

451
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:08,888
{\an8}I don't care if you're a muscle monster,
I'm not taking a step back.

452
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,770
Okay, then.

453
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,314
I'll have you guys come with me.

454
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,152
<i>He's stepping down so easily.</i>

455
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,740
But don't you dare defy me, brats!

456
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,960
Tanjiro…

457
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,301
He's huge.

458
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,971
So where are we going, Old Man?

459
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,813
The most flamboyant place in Japan
that's filled with lust and greed.

460
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,658
<i>The Entertainment District,
where the demons live.</i>

461
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,404
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

462
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,829
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BEGINNING
OF THE <i>ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC!</i>

463
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,706
Our part has finally started.

464
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,795
But are you guys sure
you're up for this mission?

465
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,297
I don't know you guys very well.

466
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,341
Go on, introduce yourselves!

467
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,218
Okay, let me start!

468
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,095
My name is Tanjiro Kamado.

469
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,596
Angelica sprout is my favorite.

470
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,723
She's Nezuko, my younger sister.

471
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,642
<i>Kompeito</i> is her favorite.

472
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,976
FAVORITE FOOD: <i>KOMPEITO</i>

473
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,437
My name is Zenitsu Agatsuma.

474
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,481
Sweet food is my favorite.

475
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,982
For example, a delightful <i>unagi</i>--

476
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,860
I didn't ask about your damn favorites!

477
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,739
I'm asking what you can do
to fight a demon!

478
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:04,493
{\an8}The demons that lurk
in the Entertainment District are strong.

479
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,328
No!

480
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,164
I don't want to die! Really! No!

481
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,916
If you don't want to die, then fight.

482
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,293
I don't even want to meet strong demons!

483
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,796
{\an8}I haven't done anything with Nezuko yet!

484
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,172
{\an8}It's impossible for me!

485
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,884
Shut up for a minute!

486
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,303
I'm Inosuke Hashibira.

487
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,182
If you want to ask me,
you'll have to beat me first.

488
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,023
What the hell is this guy talking about?

489
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,316
What?

490
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,153
Let's move on to
the Taisho-era secret for today.

491
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,822
Let me tell you about myself.

492
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,283
I come from a family of ninjas.

493
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,453
That's why I lived a plain life
as a ninja, hiding in the shadows

494
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,079
when I was a child.

495
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,414
Really?

496
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,457
You're lying!

497
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,958
Don't lie to us.

498
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,543
{\an8}It's not a lie!

499
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,964
The frustration of that time exploded, and
now I live as flamboyantly as possible.

500
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,593
Well, maybe I was born to be flamboyant.

501
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:06,180
You, too, have to show your flamboyance
on this mission to me.

502
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,684
<i>I smell a strong sense
of responsibility from him.</i>

503
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,437
<i>He's someone you can trust.</i>

504
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,648
What are you grinning for?

505
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,818
Next, episode 2,
"Entertainment District Infiltration."

506
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,237
You guys have to do your job well!

507
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,323
-Yes!
-Yes!

508
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,247
TO BE CONTINUED
